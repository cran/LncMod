Description: Predict modulators regulating the ability of effectors to regulate their targets and produce
    modulator-effector-target triplets followed by goterm functional enrichment and survival analysis.This
	is mainly applied to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as candidate modulators regulating the ability of 
	transcription factors (TFs) to regulate their corresponding targets.
